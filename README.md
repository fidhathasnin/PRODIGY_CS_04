# PRODIGY_CS-04: Simple Keylogger

A basic keylogger program that records and logs keystrokes, saving them to a file. Developed as part of my internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Features

- Logs keystrokes in real-time.
- Saves recorded keystrokes to a text file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fidhathasnin/PRODIGY_CS-04.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install pynput`
3. Run the keylogger: `python keylogger.py`
4. Press `ESC` to stop logging and exit the program.

## Ethical Considerations

This tool is intended for educational purposes only. Use it responsibly and only with explicit permission. Unauthorized use of keyloggers can be illegal and unethical.
